# Telegram bot with some kind of parser
---
## To begin with, I will tell you why this project is needed
The project was developed as a training one, in a python environment using an aiogram to work with the TG themselves. Parsing using 
- request
- aio http
- bs 4
- async io
Yes, yes, you got it right, one base with Aiogram.

It is because I studied that the code is constantly changing writing styles. New methods were used, etc. In general, I played as best I could and I advise you the same

## Project features

The most important thing is that this is the foundation. A whole, working sandbox from which you can make anything


And I also didn't like the changes in the new version of aiogram. The improvements are not bad, I just had to figure out why my sweet code stopped working.

2. Install all the necessary libraries from requirements.txt , using this code:

## Future Plans AKA Opportunities for improvement
You can always add a narrow specialization. 

The entire database is available, change command triggers, add integration with the GPT API, replace the database for data storage. 

In extreme cases, you can change the vector of the entire work altogether, there is a basis for this. 

Some examples:
1. News Telegram Bot: The parser can collect current news from various sources and send them to subscribers.
2. Price tracking bot: The parser collects prices for certain goods or services from various online stores and sends them to the user.
3. Job Search Assistant bot: Parses vacancies from popular job sites and provides information to job seekers.
4. Bot translator: The parser is able to collect information from various language resources and provide text translation into different languages.
5. Real Estate Search bot: The parser searches for real estate listings on different sites and provides the user with information about available properties.
6. Bot with the exchange rate: The parser updates the exchange rates from different banks and exchangers in real time.
7. Bot assistant for study: The parser helps to collect information from various sources to perform training tasks, for example, collects articles or books on a given topic.
8. Bot Directory: The parser finds information about various products or services and provides it to users.
9. Bot Librarian: The parser searches for books, movies or music at the user's request and offers options for buying or renting
